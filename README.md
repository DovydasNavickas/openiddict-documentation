## Security policy

## Development

## Support

If you need support, please first make sure you're [sponsoring the project](https://github.com/sponsors/kevinchalet).
Depending on the tier you selected, you can open a GitHub ticket or send an email to contact@openiddict.com for private support.

Alternatively, you can also post your question on [Gitter](https://app.gitter.im/#/room/#openiddict_openiddict-core:gitter.im).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> With OpenIddict 5.x now being generally available, the previous version, OpenIddict 4.x, stops being supported and won't receive bug
> fixes or security updates. As such, it is recommended to migrate to OpenIddict 5.x to continue receiving bug and security fixes.
> 
> **There are, however, two exceptions to this policy**:
>   - **ABP Framework 7.x users will still receive patches for OpenIddict 4.x for as long as ABP Framework 7.x itself is supported by Volosoft**
>   (typically a year following the release of ABP 8.x), whether they have a commercial ABP license or just use the free packages.
> 
>   - **OpenIddict sponsors who have opted for a $250+/month sponsorship are now offered extended support:**
>     - $250/month sponsors get full support for OpenIddict 4.x until June 18, 2024 (6 months).
>     - $500/month sponsors get full support for OpenIddict 4.x until December 18, 2024 (12 months).
>     - $1,000/month sponsors get full support for OpenIddict 4.x until December 18, 2025 (24 months).
